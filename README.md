### Data Analyst Internship – Superstore Sales Dashboard  
**Created by: Anjali Gupta**

## Project Overview
This project is part of the Data Analyst Internship Task 2, where the objective is to create meaningful visualizations and present a clear data story using Power BI.  
The dataset used is **Superstore Sales Data**, which includes sales, profit, quantity, category, state, and region information.

## Task Objective
- Create a set of visualizations using the correct chart types  
- Add context, legends, and insights to each visual  
- Build a visual story that explains the business performance  
- Avoid clutter, highlight key takeaways, and follow best design practices  
- Export the dashboard screenshots or PBIX/PBIT file for submission  

## What I Did in This Task

1. **Imported and cleaned the Superstore dataset** using Power BI.
2. Created **KPI Cards** showing:
   - Total Sales  
   - Total Profit  
   - Total Quantity Sold  
3. Built multiple visualizations:
   - **Sales by Category** (Column Chart)
   - **Sales by Sub-Category** (Horizontal Bar Chart)
   - **Profit by Region** (Column Chart)
   - **Monthly Sales Trend** (Line Chart)
   - **Sales by State** (Filled Map)
4. Added **legends, labels, colors, and tooltips** for clarity.
5. Designed a clean, easy-to-read layout with minimal clutter.
6. Created a final **Insights & Summary** section explaining the key findings.
7. Saved the dashboard as **Power BI Template (.pbit)** for submission.
