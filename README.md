### Data Analyst Internship – Superstore Sales Dashboard  
**Created by: Anjali Gupta**

## Project Overview
This project is part of the Data Analyst Internship Task 2, where the objective is to create meaningful visualizations and present a clear data story using Power BI. The dataset used is **Superstore Sales Data**, which includes sales, profit, quantity, category, state, and region information.

## Task Objective
- Create a set of visualizations using the correct chart types  
- Add context, legends, and insights to each visual  
- Build a visual story that explains the business performance  
- Avoid clutter, highlight key takeaways, and follow best design practices  
- Export the dashboard screenshots or PBIX/PBIT file for submission  

## What I Did in This Task

1. **Imported and cleaned the Superstore dataset** using Power BI.
2. Created **KPI Cards** showing:
   - Total Sales  
   - Total Profit  
   - Total Quantity Sold  
3. Built multiple visualizations:
   - **Sales by Category** (Column Chart)
   - **Sales by Sub-Category** (Horizontal Bar Chart)
   - **Profit by Region** (Column Chart)
   - **Monthly Sales Trend** (Line Chart)
   - **Sales by State** (Filled Map)
4. Added **legends, labels, colors, and tooltips** for clarity.
5. Designed a clean, easy-to-read layout with minimal clutter.
6. Created a final **Insights & Summary** section explaining the key findings.
7. Saved the dashboard as **Power BI Template (.pbit)** for submission.
8. Prepared this README.md to document the entire process.

## Superstore Sales Analysis – Insights & Storytelling

This report provides a clear view of how the business is performing across categories, regions, product segments, and time. The goal is to understand where the company is doing well and where improvements can be made. The KPI cards show the overall business picture with Total Sales, Total Profit, and Total Quantity Sold. These values act as a quick health check for the organization. The sales by category chart shows that Technology is the highest revenue generator, followed by Furniture and Office Supplies, indicating that tech products play the biggest role in driving business performance.

A deeper look into the sub-categories shows exactly which products contribute the most. Phones, Chairs, Storage, and Tables lead the rankings, while categories like Fasteners, Labels, and Envelopes generate very low revenue. This helps identify which products should be promoted and which ones need re-evaluation. The regional profit chart shows a clear difference between areas: the West and East regions are the most profitable, while the South and Central regions contribute much less. This could be due to pricing, customer demand, or operational costs in those areas. Understanding these differences can help plan better regional strategies.

The monthly trend chart highlights how sales fluctuate throughout the year. There are strong peaks in months like October, November, and December, which indicates seasonal demand—possibly holidays or year-end purchases. Meanwhile, months like February and June show lower sales, suggesting slower periods. Finally, the map visualization provides a geographic view of performance across U.S. states. It clearly shows which states generate stronger sales and where the business has weaker presence. This helps identify potential new markets and areas needing improved marketing or supply chain management.

Overall, the story reveals:
- Technology is the strongest category.
- Phones and Chairs dominate sub-category sales.
- Western and Eastern regions drive profit.
- Sales are seasonal with strong Q4 performance.
- Some states have high potential but low sales.

This analysis helps the business focus on high-value categories, understand regional differences, and make informed decisions to improve performance.
