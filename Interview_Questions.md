1. What is the importance of data visualization?
   
Ans: Data visualization helps turn raw data into clear and easy-to-understand visuals. It makes patterns, trends, and insights easier to spot. Instead of reading large tables, visuals help people make faster and better decisions.

3. When do you use a pie chart vs a bar chart?

Ans: 

- Pie Chart: Use it to show parts of a whole (percentages or proportions) when you have very few categories.
- Bar Chart: Use it to compare values across different categories. Bar charts are better when you have many categories or when values are similar.

3. How do you make visualizations more engaging?

Ans: 

- Use the right chart for the data
- Keep the design simple and clean
- Highlight important values or trends
- Use limited colors
- Add clear titles, labels, and notes
- Focus on insights, not decoration

4. What is data storytelling?
   
Ans: Data storytelling is the process of combining data, visualizations, and insights to tell a clear and meaningful story. It explains what is happening, why it is happening, and what actions should be taken based on the data.

6. How do you avoid misleading visualizations?

Ans:

- Use proper scales (don’t start bar charts at random values)
- Avoid too many colors or confusing designs
- Don’t exaggerate differences
- Label charts clearly
- Use the right chart type
- Ensure data is accurate and complete

6. What are best practices in dashboard design?

Ans: 

- Keep layout clean and simple
- Show the most important information at the top
- Use consistent colors and fonts
- Avoid clutter
- Use filters/slicers for interactivity
- Include KPIs for quick understanding
- Make sure everything has a purpose
